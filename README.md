The html version of the project can be found [here](https://leyaof.github.io/Notebooks/movie-analysis.html) 

#### Introduction
This project uses metadata from TMDb on movies released on or before 2017. In this analysis I will explore different features of a movie such as genres, budget, revenue and runtime. I will also build a regression model to predict the revenue of a movie based on its features.

#### Dataset
The datasets used in this analysis are from Kaggle which can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/tmdb/tmdb-movie-metadata).
